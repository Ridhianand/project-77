       <p>Hi my name is Ridhi Anand and this is my first project on Visual Studio Code </p>
       <hr>
       <p> Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. 
           Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets,
            code refactoring, and embedded Git.</p>
            <h1> Visual Studio Code is a free coding editor that helps you start coding quickly. Use it to code 
                in any programming language, without switching editors. Visual Studio Code has support for many
                 languages, including Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and more.In contrast, Visual Studio Code 
                 can be classed as an integrated development environment (IDE), meaning that developers can 
                 write and test code at the same time.</h1>
